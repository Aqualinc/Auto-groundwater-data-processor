Project WL20023 Christchurch City Council APP..
Prepared by Tim Kerr, Rainfall.NZ for Aqualinc.
March 2020

Background
Christchurch City Council have a large number of piezometers measuring groundwater levels at short intervals (10 minutes).
These piezometers are downloaded intermittantly.
Its helpfull to stitch the data together after each download.

********** There is an issue with the am/pm formatting. This needs to be manually checked each time.
This could be turned into a function which accepted Old directory, and new directory, and save directory, and magic could then happen.

```{r}
if (!require(zoo)) install.packages("zoo"); library(zoo)
if (!require(lubridate)) install.packages("lubridate"); library(lubridate)

PreviousDataDirectory <- "H:\\WL Projects\\WL20023_CCC APP\\Data 2020\\AllDataV0"
LatestDataDirectory <- "D:\\Projects\\Aqualinc\\projects\\APP\\Data\\Data Harvest 5\\Data Harvest 5"
#LatestDataDirectory <- "H:\\WL Projects\\WL20023_CCC APP\\Data 2020\\BaroAndOffsetCorrected"


SaveDataDirectory <- "H:\\WL Projects\\WL20023_CCC APP\\Data 2020\\AllData"

#Prepare a list of all the APP numbers

#Get a file list from the download data directories
DownloadFileNames <- c(list.files(path=c(PreviousDataDirectory,LatestDataDirectory),pattern="^APP[0-9]*_[0-9]*-[0-9]*.csv",recursive =TRUE,full.names = TRUE),
                       list.files(path=c(PreviousDataDirectory,LatestDataDirectory),pattern="^[0-9]*_.*Compensated.csv",recursive =TRUE,full.names = TRUE))

                       
#Parse the file names to give just the APP numbers. Regex explanation. I'm testing for two possible matches divided by the or (|) symbol. The replacement assumes there is only ever one match so it makes no difference if both matches are delivered. Does that make any sense? 
APPNumbers <- as.numeric(sub(pattern="^APP([0-9]*)_.*csv|^([0-9]*)_.*csv","\\1\\2",x=basename(DownloadFileNames)))

#Get just the unique APP numbers
APPNumbersUnique <- unique(APPNumbers)


#Concatenate the download files for each site writing a new file for each one as we go

for (APPNumber in APPNumbersUnique) { #APPNumber <- 3
  #Get the filenames associated with that APP number, but don't use the "initial_QA" files as in at least one case (APP 5), the initial_QA and the first proper download have the same time, but different values in the data.
  
  #browser()
  
  print(paste("Processing APP number",APPNumber))
  FileIndices <- which(APPNumbers == APPNumber)
  
  GWFiles <- DownloadFileNames[FileIndices]

  #load these files without headers, stick them together, and then stick them in the complete file, removing any duplicate date-time entries.
  #There are two types of files, Aqualinc formatted and T&T formatted. Aqualinc has a single header line. T&T has 12 header lines.
  #Additionally, T&T don't invert their levels, but Aqualinc do.
  InputDataLists <- lapply(GWFiles, function(FileOfInterest) {  #FileOfInterest <- GWFiles[1]
    if(substring(basename(FileOfInterest),1,3) == "APP") {
      SkipLines <- 0
      LevelsMultiplier <- 1
      }else {
        SkipLines = 11
        LevelsMultiplier <- -1
      }
    GroundwaterRawData <- read.csv(FileOfInterest, stringsAsFactors = FALSE,skip = SkipLines)
    GroundwaterRawData$LEVEL <- GroundwaterRawData$LEVEL * LevelsMultiplier
    return(GroundwaterRawData[,c("Date","Time","LEVEL","TEMPERATURE")])
  } )

  #It seems the locale is different from machine to machine. I have locale on my laptop set to "English_New zealand.1252" which has the am/pm format as am/pm or AM/PM, but NOT a.m./p.m.. So completely different to what was working at Aqualinc! I haven't check ed the Aqualinc locale yet.
  
  #I need to get the date and time in order, so turn it into a zoo time series object using the date and time columns to build the index
  #There is this annoying thing where am and pm are not recognsed but a.m. and p.m. are. Apparently this is a "locale" thing.
  #So i need to replace the am's with a.m. and the pm's with p.m.
  #
  #InputDataCombined$Time <- sub("am","a.m.",InputDataCombined$Time)
  #InputDataCombined$Time <- sub("pm","p.m.",InputDataCombined$Time)

  #InputDataCombined$Time <- sub("PM","p.m.",InputDataCombined$Time)
  
  InputDataCombined$Time <- sub("a.m.","am",InputDataCombined$Time)
  InputDataCombined$Time <- sub("p.m.","pm",InputDataCombined$Time)

  
  #Even more annoyingly, the time is not in a consistent format between files, sometimes it has the am/pm sometimes it has a 24 hour time.
  #So I need to convert both types and stick them together.
  #But note that the 24 hour format still converts the am/pm format (and gets it wrong), but the am/pm format returns an NA for the 24 hour format as it can't find the am/pm characters. So I do both conversions, and then swap out the NA values from the am/pm attempt with the 24 hour versions. This assumes everything that is not in am/pm format is in 25 hour format.
